1. data.txt
the primary tab-delimited table containing data on the avian tolerance towards humans 
(measured as the flight intiation distance) and a set of predictors in urban birds

Country - the name of the country where data were collected
IDLocality - unique ID for all sampled sites
Lat - latitude in decimal degrees
Lon - longitude in decimal degrees
Covid - period (0 = before the COVID-19 shutdowns; 1 = during the COVID-19 shutdowns)
Year - year of data collection
Day - day order since the start of the breeding season (Europe: Day 1 = 1 April; Australia: Day 1 = 15 August)
Hour - the time of data collection (in hours)
Temp - the ambient air temperature (°C)
StringencyIndex - the strength of governmental measures rescaled to values from 0 to 100 (0 = no restrictions; 100 = strictest restrictions) 
Species - the scientific (Latin) name of the species as used in the BirdTree project (http://birdtree.org/)
FlockSize - the flock size
SD - the starting distance of observer (m)
FID - the flight initiation distance (m)
